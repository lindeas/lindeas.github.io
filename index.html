        <h2>jilo-agent</h2>

        Shell script on a remote jitsi machine. Runs periodically to fetch data from the jitsi logs. Jilo Agent can then send them to the server.

        <ul>
            <li><strong>jilo</strong> - server side tool for gathering data from Jitsi logs</li>

        <h1>TotalMeet</h1>
        <a href="https://totalmeet.com">TotalMeet</a> is a hosted webconferencing solution, based on Jitsi Meet.

        <p>
            <img src="https://code.lindeas.com/lindeas/.profile/media/branch/main/screenshot-totalmeet.png" alt="totalmeet" />
        </p>

        <p>It has a custom user profile and dashboard pages, and is aimed at helping communities and small to medium businesses get most out of Jitsi Meet.</p>

        <p>You can use our own jitsi backend, or you can connect it to an external one - either your own or the official hosted backend from the Jitsi project, <a href="https://jaas.8x8.vc/">JaaS</a>.</p>

        <p>TotalMeet is still under construction, but if you are interested, please subscribe on the website to get notified once we launch it.</p>

        <p>If you are interested in a custom TotalMeet deployment, tailored to your specific needs, please <a href="mailto:contact%40totalmeet.com?subject=TotalMeet%20custom%20deployment">contact us directly</a>.</p>
