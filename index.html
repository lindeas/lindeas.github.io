<h1>TotalMeet</h1>
TotalMeet is a hosted webconferencing solution, based on Jitsi Meet.
<hr />

<p>It has a custom user profile and dashboard pages, and is aimed at helping communities and small to medium businesses get most out of Jitsi Meet.</p>

<p>You can use our own jitsi backend, or you can connect it to an external one - either your own or the official hosted backend from the Jitsi project, <a href="https://jaas.8x8.vc/">JaaS</a>.</p>

<p>TotalMeet is still under construction, but if you are interested, please subscribe on the website to get notified once we launch it.</p>

<p>If you are interested in a custom TotalMeet deployment, tailored to your specific needs, please <a href="mailto:contact%40totalmeet.com?subject=TotalMeet%20custom%20deployment">contact us directly</a>.</p>
